**Blog App**

**Description**

This Blog App is a full-stack web application that enables users to write, share, and engage with blogs in real time. It features secure JWT-based authentication, a responsive and modern user interface, and seamless front-end/back-end integration using the MERN stack.

A standout feature of this app is its AI-powered blog description generator, which uses Google Gemini API to create intelligent, context-aware content based on the blog title. This demonstrates my ability to integrate artificial intelligence into web applications and build scalable, high-performance systems.

Additionally, the app ensures persistent storage of blogs and comments using MongoDB, real-time user presence tracking, and a smooth user experience through efficient API communication and component-based architecture.
